# VTOLVR-MissionAssistant
## Me
I am diditoday on the Discord server, my name is Aaron and I love designing missions for VTOL VR.

## My YouTube
I have a couple of YouTube channels dedicated to VTOL VR. 
*VTOL VR Make Stuff - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6zz6YGMo8_QdAXaQzZOAAgu7B42P00rU
*VTOL VR Learn Stuff - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6zz6YGMo8_RTIzyZupO-wV9wDDusJRyS

They are the best but they are bad either. They are videos to try to help show and understand how the mission editor in VTOL VR works.

## The Project
It is just me on this project for now but others may join in the future who knows. 

## The Application
VTOL VR Mission Assistant helps in managing and modifying the VTS file for VTOL VR missions. However, it is not a replacement for the mission editor in VTOL VR itself. It just provides some extra functionality I wish was natively there. Like the ability to re-index your units so they are sequential again or the ability to copy anything you want (like IF ELSE IF ELSE chains).
