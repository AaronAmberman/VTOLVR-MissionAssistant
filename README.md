# VTOLVR-MissionAssistant
## Me
I am diditoday on the Discord server, my name is Aaron and I love designing missions for VTOL VR.

## The Application
VTOL VR Mission Assistant helps in managing and modifying the VTS file for VTOL VR missions. However, it is not a replacement for the mission editor in VTOL VR itself. It just provides some extra functionality I wish was natively there. Like the ability to re-index your units so they are sequential again or the ability to copy anything you want (like IF ELSE IF ELSE chains).
